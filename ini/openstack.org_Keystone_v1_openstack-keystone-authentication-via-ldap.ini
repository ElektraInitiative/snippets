#@META description = Minimal OpenStack Keystone config to allow user authentication via LDAP (also for OpenStack internal accounts). This config was tested (and is used) for a single default domain only.
Roles and projects are managed by Keystone itself. So just user accounts are sourced from LDAP. 

You need to adopt it to your needs, mostly you need a vaild bind-user account for the settings ldap/user and ldap/password.

integrate it with your full /etc/keystone/keystone.conf configuration
