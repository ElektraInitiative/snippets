#@META description = This is rather an description of an idea than a configuration file. The idea is to have very short config files per host, have all common stuff in common.inc and have symlinks from current.prf to concrete configs on every host. Then the configts can be shared via unison, too (only excluding the symlink). Template tags are written in <tag>
