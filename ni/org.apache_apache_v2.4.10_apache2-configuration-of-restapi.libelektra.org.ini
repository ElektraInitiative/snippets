 description = This is the apache2 configuration we use for restapi.libelektra.org (port 443, SSL). It serves as proxy (using SCGI) for our rest-backend which is basically a custom instance of CppCMS.\n\nThe rest-backend listens on the local port 8081 for requests that are sent through the SCGI adapter. So the apache webserver does just tunnel requests to the rest-backend.
