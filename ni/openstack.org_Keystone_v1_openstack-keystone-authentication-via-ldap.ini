 description = Minimal OpenStack Keystone config to allow user authentication via LDAP (also for OpenStack internal accounts). This config was tested (and is used) for a single default domain only.\nRoles and projects are managed by Keystone itself. So just user accounts are sourced from LDAP. \n\nYou need to adopt it to your needs, mostly you need a vaild bind-user account for the settings ldap/user and ldap/password.\n\nintegrate it with your full /etc/keystone/keystone.conf configuration
