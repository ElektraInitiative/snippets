 description = This is the apache2 configuration we use for blob.libelektra.org (port 443, SSL). It allows users to create links that point to files in our repository (currently on GitHub).\n\nhttps://blob.libelektra.org/src/plugins/README.md would be a valid link, while https://blob.libelektra.org/src/plugins/ would lead to a 404 error (a directory cannot be displayed as blob on GitHub).
